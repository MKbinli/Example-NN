There was no time for final date of assignment , therefore I couldn't add simple model. Hyperparameter tuning need to be done for complex model. LSTM can be added instead of wavenet.
In my opinion, it is really hard to predict univariate and multistep problems. From the point of my view, I may have made a mistake by seperatin data to 0 parts at the begining.
